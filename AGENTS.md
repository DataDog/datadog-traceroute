# AI Agents & Tools

This document tracks the use of AI agents and tools in the development of datadog-traceroute.

## Purpose

AI tools may be used to assist with various development tasks including:
- Code analysis and understanding
- Problem diagnosis and troubleshooting
- Implementation assistance
- Testing and verification
- Documentation

## Best Practices

When using AI agents in this project:

1. **Always Review**: AI-generated code must be reviewed by maintainers
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Run all tests and verify behavior
3. **Document Changes**: Provide clear commit messages and PR descriptions
4. **Maintain Standards**: Follow project coding conventions
5. **Validate Logic**: Ensure solutions are technically sound
6. **Human Oversight**: Final decisions on architecture and implementation remain with maintainers

## Attribution

Commits that received significant AI assistance should be clearly marked in commit messages to maintain transparency.

## Transparency

We believe in transparency about AI usage:
- AI suggestions are reviewed and validated by human developers
- AI is a tool to assist, not replace, human judgment
- All AI-assisted work should be clearly documented
- Decisions about accepting AI contributions rest with project maintainers

## Documentation Template

When documenting AI-assisted contributions, include:
- **Problem**: What issue was being addressed
- **Approach**: How the solution was designed
- **Files Modified**: What changed
- **Key Decisions**: Important architectural or implementation choices
- **Testing**: How the changes were verified
- **Limitations**: Any areas requiring additional human review

## Future Updates

This document should be updated as AI tools are used for contributions. Document lessons learned and evolving best practices for AI collaboration in the project.
